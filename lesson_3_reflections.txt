When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    There is a lot of advantages using remote repository, some of those I've
    listed bellow:
    - We can access your main repository from everywhere, work, house, university, etc.
    - Once it's "on the cloud" you are protected against eventual failures to your
      Hard Drive, seriouslly, it can save your life!
    - We can now colaborate with other people that want to work on the same project easily.
    - You can use the online remote repository as an portfolio of your work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
